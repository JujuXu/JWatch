# Digital Smartwatch Project

## üïí Overview

This project focuses on creating a **compact, waterproof digital smartwatch** that combines wireless connectivity (**Bluetooth & Wi-Fi**) with a variety of smart features. Designed as a **bracelet-style wearable**, the smartwatch will feature an OLED or e-paper display, RFID functionality for access control, **health monitoring sensors**, and seamless integration with iOS devices.

## üî• Key Features

- **Compact and waterproof design**
- **Wireless connectivity**: Wi-Fi (hosted on ESP32) and Bluetooth (AVRCP for media control)
- **RFID integration**: Unlock doors using an embedded RFID antenna
- **Health monitoring**: Track heart rate and SpO2 with the **MAX30102 sensor**
- **Wireless updates (OTA)**: Simplify code deployment without requiring a USB connection
- **Magnetic charging**: Ensures waterproof charging capabilities
- **Media control**: Manage iPhone music playback directly from the watch
- **Internal sensors**:
  - Temperature and pressure measurement for safety and altitude detection
  - Brightness adaptation to optimize screen visibility
  - Angular acceleration and gyroscope for motion-based interaction (e.g., wrist gestures to light up the screen)
- **Haptic feedback**: Enhance user experience with tactile interactions

## üì° Connectivity

- **Wi-Fi (ESP32-hosted)**: Enables direct connections for OTA updates and acts as a mobile access point for development purposes
- **Bluetooth AVRCP**: Provides iPhone media control
- **RFID security**: Allows the smartwatch to unlock access points

## ‚öôÔ∏è PCB Prototyping & Development

- Breadboard-friendly PCBs are utilized during the early testing phase to simplify component integration.
- The final PCB design will consolidate all modules into a **streamlined, compact form factor**.

## üìå Project Roadmap

1. Project initialization
2. Setting up prerequisites
3. Creating a testing PCB for SMD components
4. Component testing
5. Developing firmware and features
6. Validating functionality
7. Designing the final product
8. Hopefully, not missing the broken iWatch too much!
