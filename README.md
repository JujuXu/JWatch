# Digital Smartwatch Project

## üïí Overview

This project aims to create a **compact and waterproof digital smartwatch** with wireless connectivity (**Bluetooth & Wi-Fi**) and multiple smart features. The watch is designed as a **bracelet-style wearable** with an OLED or e-paper display. It includes RFID functionality for access control, **health monitoring sensors**, and seamless interaction with iOS devices.

## üî• Features

- **Compact smartwatch design** with a focus on **waterproofing**
- **Wireless connectivity**: Wi-Fi (ESP32 Hosted), Bluetooth (AVRCP for media control)
- **RFID integration**: Unlock doors via an embedded RFID antenna
- **Health monitoring**: Heart rate & SpO2 measurement using **MAX30102**
- **Wireless code deployment (OTA)**: No need for USB cable
- **Magnetic charging**: Avoids compromising waterproofing
- **Media control**: Interact with iPhone music playback
- **Custom PCB design**: Breadboard-friendly prototyping for component testing

## üõ† Hardware

- **ESP32** as the main microcontroller (Wi-Fi & Bluetooth)
- **MAX30102** for heart rate and SpO2 monitoring
- **RFID module** with integrated antenna
- **OLED/E-Paper Display** for user interface
- **Magnetic charging interface** for waterproof power delivery
- **Custom PCB** for integration & prototyping

## üì° Connectivity
